Use pandas to analyze a dataset

# Overview

I am analyzing data related to fetal health classification, including markers for predicting the fetuses health. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification

While I mostly analyze business datasets, I have an interest in clinical informatics and bioinformatics. I felt this was a good intro to analyzing health datasets. 

Below is a walkthrough of my Python program where I analyze fetal health data.

# Data Analysis Questions & Answers

* Question 1: Do fetuses whose mothers endure longer uterine contractions have higher abnormal short term variability? 
* Answer 1: No, actually fetuses have higher abnormal short term variability if their mothers experience shorter uterine contractions.

* Question 2: Do fetuses with lower baseline heart rates have higher percentage of time with abnormal long term variability?
* Answer 2: Yes, based on our line graph, we can identify that fetuses with lower baseline heart rates experience higher percentage of time with abnormal long term variability. 

* Question 3 (stretch challenge): Do fetuses with histograms with more peaks have a higher chance of fetal mortality? 
* Answer 3: Based on our scatter plot results we can see that fetuses with more peaks in their histograms are more commonly diagnosed as having a normal fetal health prediction.
