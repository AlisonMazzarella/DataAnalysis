# DataAnalysis
Use pandas to analyze a dataset

# Overview

I am analyzing data related to fetal health classification, including markers for predicting the fetuses health. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification

While I mostly analyze business datasets, I have an interest in clinical informatics and bioinformatics. I felt this was a good intro to analyzing health datasets. 

Below is a walkthrough of my Python program where I analyze fetal health data.

# Data Analysis Questions

#Question 1: Do fetuses whose mothers endure higher uterine contractions have higher abnormal short term variability?
#Question 2: Do fetuses with lower baseline heart rates have higher percentage of time with abnormal long term variability?
#Question 3 (stretch challenge): Do prolongued decelerations lead to higher infant mortality predictions? 

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code

Python 
Pandas
